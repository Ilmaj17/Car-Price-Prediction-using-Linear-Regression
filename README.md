# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
The sets were downloaded using kaggle.com.
I had only considered few numerical data such as popularity and number of doors etc..
I disregarded the categorical data as they have to be dealt in a separate way.
The target variable msrp ( the price of the car) was determined using taking the log as it didn't show a normal distribution.
The rmse was used to predict the accuracy of the machine learning model, which was able to attain an accuracy of 0.5037 which is pretty a good one.
